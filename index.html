        ultramodern architecture and a lively nightlife scene. Burj Khalifa, an 830m-tall tower, 
        dominates the skyscraper-filled skyline. At its foot lies Dubai Fountain, with jets and lights choreographed to music.
         On artificial islands just offshore is Atlantis, The Palm, a resort with water and marine-animal parks.
